<p>           This is just a simple pattern, next time you are trading cryptocurrencies, try and spot one of these</p>
<p2><i> disclaimer: this is not financial advice. 
This is simply the compounded knowledge of a degenerate trader who knows absolutely nothing and is definitely not someone who should be giving any advice.
all trading involves financial risk, don't put more than you are willing to use. best if you don't trade with more than $1 until you have proven you can be profitable</i></p2>

Notice the pattern below. It will be in all the screenshots you see here today. 
The pattern is not reliant upon the time frame, and is not reliant on being a specific cryptocurrency.
Try to spot it in each chart. It occurs after a downtrend and may signal a large bounce up, or a shift to an uptrend.    <br>            .

<br>
Notice there are three parts to it. The first bottom, the second one which reaches further than the first, 
and the third, which reaches its support at or slightly above the same price as the first bottom(in between the high and the low of the first bottom).

<br> Please be aware this will not always work, yet almost all the time it at least reaches the "flat ground" or high before the first bottom, so It may be a good point to set your takeprofit there.

There are some exeptions to this pattern, including a double bottom on the "middle bottom",
 the third support being noticably lower than the first support, and a significant delay without a sharp move up on the third component.

You will find this pattern in many cryptocurrencies, if you have time look at the chart history of whichever you like and try to spot these. 
This is seen in coins such as BTC to memecoins such as SHIB(usually in more volatile coins)
<br>
I don't know what makes this pattern work, the possibilities being a reflection of traders' psychology, or a "self fulfilling prophecy", in which 
the crypto moves up based on other people recognizing this pattern and buying. 
<br>
I would go more in detail on this and add more examples, but I honestly don't know why I am even making this website right now and I'm too lazy to do more work, 
so this concludes the worthless guide of TheUselessCryptoChartPattern. Up next: TheRetardedBlueberrrTrades episode 1?
